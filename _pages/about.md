# üëã About Me

Hi, everyone! I am currently a junior undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai). I serve as a research assistant at Harbin Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Dianbo Sui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yi639zEAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, I am a visiting student at Westlake University in the LINs Lab, working under the guidance of [Prof. Tao Lin](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=QE9pa_cAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests include Deep Learning Theory, Large Language Models, Interpretability, Complex Systems, and Statistical Mechanics.
